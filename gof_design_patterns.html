            <h2>Creational Patterns (5)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Singleton:</strong> Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.</li>
                <li><strong>Factory Method:</strong> Defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses alter the type of created objects.</li>
                <li><strong>Abstract Factory:</strong> Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.</li>
                <li><strong>Builder:</strong> Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.</li>
                <li><strong>Prototype:</strong> Creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="structural-patterns">
            <h2>Structural Patterns (7)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Adapter:</strong> Allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface.</li>
                <li><strong>Bridge:</strong> Decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.</li>
                <li><strong>Composite:</strong> Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.</li>
                <li><strong>Decorator:</strong> Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.</li>
                <li><strong>Facade:</strong> Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.</li>
                <li><strong>Flyweight:</strong> Reduces the cost of creating and manipulating a large number of similar objects.</li>
                <li><strong>Proxy:</strong> Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="behavioral-patterns">
            <h2>Behavioral Patterns (11)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Chain of Responsibility:</strong> Passes a request along a chain of handlers.</li>
                <li><strong>Command:</strong> Encapsulates a request as an object.</li>
                <li><strong>Interpreter:</strong> Defines a representation for the grammar of a language and an interpreter to use the representation to interpret sentences in the language.</li>
                <li><strong>Iterator:</strong> Provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.</li>
                <li><strong>Mediator:</strong> Defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact.</li>
                <li><strong>Memento:</strong> Captures and externalizes an object's internal state without violating encapsulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Observer:</strong> Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all dependents are notified and updated automatically.</li>
                <li><strong>State:</strong> Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.</li>
                <li><strong>Strategy:</strong> Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.</li>
                <li><strong>Template Method:</strong> Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses.</li>
                <li><strong>Visitor:</strong> Allows adding new operations to classes without modifying them.</li>
            </ul>
