# GoF Design Patterns

## Creational Patterns
### 1. Abstract Factory

Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

### 2. Builder

Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create various representations.

### 3. Factory Method

Defines an interface for creating a single object while letting subclasses decide which class to instantiate.

### 4. Prototype

Specifies the kinds of objects to create from a prototypical instance and creates new objects by copying this prototype.

### 5. Singleton

Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

## Structural Patterns
### 1. Adapter

Converts the interface of a class into another interface that clients expect.

### 2. Bridge

Decouples an abstraction from its implementation, allowing the two to vary independently.

### 3. Composite

Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.

### 4. Decorator

Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.

### 5. Facade

Provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.

### 6. Flyweight

Uses sharing to support large numbers of similar objects efficiently.

### 7. Proxy

Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

## Behavioral Patterns
### 1. Chain of Responsibility

Avoids coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving multiple objects a chance to handle the request.

### 2. Command

Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing for parameterization of clients with different requests.

### 3. Iterator

Provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

### 4. Mediator

Defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact.

### 5. Memento

Captures and externalizes an object’s internal state without violating encapsulation.

### 6. Observer

Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, where a state change in one object results in notifications to dependent objects.

### 7. State

Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.

### 8. Strategy

Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulating each one and making them interchangeable.

### 9. Template Method

Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses.

### 10. Visitor

Represents an operation to be performed on elements of a set of classes, allowing new operations to be defined without changing the classes.

### 11. Specification

Defines the criteria to select and execute a given operation.
